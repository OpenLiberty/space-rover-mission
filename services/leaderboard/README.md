# Leaderboard Service

The Leaderboard Service is built using Open Liberty. It is used to provide a REST API for the Client to query for past game information and for the Game Service to add the information after a game completes. To persist this data, the Leaderboard Service interacts with MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

## Models

LeaderboardEntry
```
{
  _id: ObjectId
  player: String
  score: int
  time: int
  health: int
  timestamp: String
}
```

## Endpoints

`POST /mongo/leaderboard`: Add a new leaderboard entry

`GET /mongo/leaderboard`: Get all leaderboard entries
